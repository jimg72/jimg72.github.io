Hopefully I'll start writing some now that I got this going again. It's been a minute.

For those of y'all keeping score at home, I live in Dallas, Texas with my wife, 2 dogs, and a cat. I'm a database engineer (consultant) by trade, but I also enjoy collecting sports cards of former Ole Miss Rebels. Besides my alma mater Ole Miss, my fandom extends to the New Orleans Saints, Atlanta Braves, Texas Rangers, and Dallas Stars. That's an odd mix I know, I spent most of my life in Mississippi, but have lived in Dallas for almost 18 years.
