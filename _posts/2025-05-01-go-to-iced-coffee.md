**Gear:**

- [Keurig K-Iced Coffee Maker](https://amzn.to/4d3MGVG) (cold button, 8oz setting)
- [Anchor Hocking Glass Beaker Measuring Cup](https://amzn.to/4lXBwWf) or similar
- [YETI Rambler 14 oz Mug](https://amzn.to/44X1lQ6) or similar

**Ingredients:**

- Dunkin’ Cold Iced Coffee pod (French Vanilla)
- Ice
- Your favorite creamer

**Steps:**

1. Fill your glass measuring cup halfway with ice.
2. Brew an 8oz cup using the cold brew button directly into the iced glass.
3. Stir or shake vigorously until most of the ice melts—this chills the coffee without watering it down too much.
4. In your YETI mug, add a fresh scoop of ice (same amount as before).
5. Pour in the chilled coffee.
6. Add creamer to taste and stir.

**Result:** A bold, chilled iced coffee that’s easy to make at home and strong enough to kick-start your day.
