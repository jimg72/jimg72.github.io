Hey there, I'm Jim Graham! Welcome to my little corner of the internet where I casually chat about data engineering, sports cards, sports in general, and life around Dallas, TX.

I've been working with databases for about 25 years—starting my journey with Oracle before diving deep into data warehousing. These days, I'm a big fan of Snowflake, having recently earned my SnowPro Core certification (with my sights set on grabbing a few more certifications this year!).

When I'm not crunching data, you'll likely find me exploring my passion for sports card collecting. I'm especially into cards featuring players from my alma mater, Ole Miss. Favorites in my collection include legends like Archie Manning, Eli Manning, and Deuce McAllister.

Speaking of Ole Miss, I'm a huge Rebels fan, closely following football, baseball, and now even a little basketball. On the professional side, my teams are the New Orleans Saints (NFL), Atlanta Braves and Texas Rangers (MLB), and the Dallas Stars (NHL). Needless to say, sports keep me pretty busy year-round!

Living in Dallas, I love discovering great new places to eat—particularly if it's casual TexMex or an amazing burger spot. Fine dining isn't really my scene; give me a relaxed atmosphere and delicious comfort food any day.

Fun fact about me, my wife and I got married on Zoom in 2020 because of COVID. And last but definitely not least, I have two adorable miniature dachshunds named Sippi and Ember, who keep life interesting and fun!
